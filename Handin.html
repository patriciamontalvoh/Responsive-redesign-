    <p class="title-03"> Responsive Redesign </p>
    <p class="title-04"> Chosen webpage:</p>
    <p class="title-04">  https://health.ri.gov/ </p>
    <p class="title-04"> The chosen website was the Home page of the Rhode Island department of health. Currently, despite the need for a simple and accessible design, this webpage lacks organization and does not have a practical layout to ensure the users can navigate it efficiently. Given the many problems identified and the low evaluation scores for accessibility and overall UX, I choose tho redesign this webpage in order to modify its design to a more straightforward and user-friendly interface. </p>
